# 🧪 MODULE 1: Weather-Based Dengue Risk Predictor (Forecasting)

**Goal:** Predict dengue outbreak risk based on current weather and climatic conditions of a city.

✔️ User Input:
- City Name (e.g., Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore)

✔️ Features:
- Fetch live weather data using **OpenWeatherMap API**
- Consider the following factors:
  - Temperature (°C) → Ideal: 25–30°C
  - Humidity (%) → High risk if >70%
  - Rainfall (mm) → High risk if >50mm/week
  - Season (e.g., Monsoon, Post-monsoon → higher risk)
  - Wind speed (affects mosquito spread)
  - Mosquito lifecycle duration (affects transmission risk)

✔️ Risk Logic (Example – can be improved with ML later):
```python
risk_score = 0

if 25 <= temperature <= 30:
    risk_score += 2
if humidity > 70:
    risk_score += 2
if rainfall > 50:
    risk_score += 2
if season in ['Monsoon', 'Post-Monsoon']:
    risk_score += 2
if 1 <= wind_speed <= 10:
    risk_score += 1  # mosquitoes thrive

# Risk Levels
if risk_score >= 7:
    risk = "High Risk"
elif 4 <= risk_score < 7:
    risk = "Moderate Risk"
else:
    risk = "Low Risk"
✔️ Output:

Show weather data with icons 🌡️💧🌧️🌪️

Show Dengue Risk: Low, Moderate, or High

Show explanation for each risk factor

✔️ UI Theme:

Use cool colors (green/blue), mosquito icon 🦟

Header: "Weather-Based Dengue Risk Predictor"

🚨 MODULE 2: Local Dengue Alert System (Case-Based Tracking)
Goal: Show current outbreak alerts based on real dengue case reports.

✔️ User Input:

City / District / State Name

✔️ Features:

Load data from a CSV (e.g., dengue_cases.csv) with columns:

City, District, State, Reported_Cases, Week, Month

Analyze trends:

Daily/Weekly/Monthly rise in cases

Identify hotspots (if >50 cases in a city)

Show community-level alert level:

Low Risk (0–4 cases)

Watch (5–19 cases)

Moderate (20–49 cases)

High Alert (50+ cases)

✔️ Output:

Alert level badge 🔴🟠🟡🟢

Safety recommendations

Trend chart (optional with matplotlib or chart.js)

Emergency contact section (108, 104, local health)

✔️ UI Theme:

Use red/orange theme, siren icon 🚨

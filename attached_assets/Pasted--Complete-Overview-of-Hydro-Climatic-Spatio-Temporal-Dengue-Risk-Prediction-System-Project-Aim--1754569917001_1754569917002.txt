🔬 Complete Overview of Hydro-Climatic Spatio-Temporal Dengue Risk Prediction System
🎯 Project Aim:
This project aims to predict dengue outbreaks based on weather conditions, past dengue case data, and user-reported risk factors.
By integrating climate analysis, symptom checkers, location-based alerts, and preventive guidance, the system enables users to assess dengue risk in their locality and take necessary precautions in advance.

💡 Core Idea:
Dengue is deeply influenced by hydro-climatic conditions like rainfall, temperature, and humidity. These environmental factors create favorable conditions for mosquito breeding and viral transmission.

By analyzing historical weather data, dengue outbreak trends, and user-submitted information, we can predict potential dengue outbreaks and provide early warnings, reducing the spread and impact.

🔍 Feature Breakdown:
1️⃣ Weather-Based Dengue Risk Prediction 🌦
Pull live weather data using OpenWeatherMap API (temperature, humidity, rainfall).

Analyze data using rule-based logic or a lightweight ML model.

Display user-specific dengue risk level: Low, Medium, High.

📊 Example Rule:

python
Copy
Edit
if temperature > 25 and humidity > 70 and rainfall > 50:
    risk = "High"
2️⃣ Symptom-Based Dengue Risk Checker ✅
Ask users if they have symptoms like:

Fever

Joint pain

Rashes

Vomiting

Based on WHO guidelines, give Low / Medium / High risk levels.

3️⃣ Local Dengue Alert System 🚨
Users enter their district or city name.

The system checks against a CSV/database of reported dengue cases.

If risk is high in that area → Alert the user with warning messages and do’s/don’ts.

4️⃣ Score-Based Dengue Risk Calculator 📊
Ask yes/no lifestyle/environment questions like:

"Is there stagnant water near your home?"

"Have you seen more mosquitoes lately?"

Each "yes" gets a score (1 point).

Total score between 0–10 → Show suggestions accordingly.

5️⃣ Spatio-Temporal Visualization of Dengue Spread 🗺
Load historical data (from Kaggle or WHO) to generate:

Heatmaps of affected zones (using Google Maps API or Folium)

Time-series graphs (using Matplotlib)

Helps identify high-risk patterns geographically and seasonally.

6️⃣ Prevention & Awareness Hub 📢
Static section with:

Tips to avoid dengue

Do’s and Don’ts

Infographics/videos (hosted locally or via YouTube)

FAQs related to dengue

⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools
Layer	Tools

📊 Data Sources Needed
✅ Kaggle dataset: Dengue cases over time in India

✅ OpenWeatherMap API: Live temperature, rainfall, humidity

✅ Government health bulletins (convert PDFs to CSV)

✅ Custom dengue_cases.csv file for local alert system

🔄 System Workflow
User opens the app (Web/Mobile).

Chooses one of the modules:

Weather Prediction

Symptom Checker

Local Alert

Risk Calculator

Spatio-Temporal Analysis

Awareness Section

System processes the inputs.

Based on input and historical data → Predicts dengue risk.

User receives:

Risk Level

Alert (if needed)
